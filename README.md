# Point-GNN: Graph Neural Network for 3D Object Detection in a Point Cloud (CVPR 2020)
## Unofficial PyTorch Implementation

In this repository I will provide an alternative implementation of the recently proposed Point-GNN in PyTorch and try to reproduce the results of the original publication on the KITTI 3D Object Detection Benchmark.
The official implementation in Tensorflow can be found [here:](https://github.com/WeijingShi/Point-GNN)
